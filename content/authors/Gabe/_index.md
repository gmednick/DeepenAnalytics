I have had a passionate affair with bioinformatics and data science over the last several years. What started out as an effort to expand my scientific toolbox turned into a love for programming and predictive modeling that has transformed my skill set and professional pursuits. I enjoy the challenge of drawing insight from new data. 

When I find time outside of coding and family, I like to spend time in the ocean surfing or the beach playing volleyball.
