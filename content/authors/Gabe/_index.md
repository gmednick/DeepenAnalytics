I have expertise as a biochemist but I am most passionate about bioinformatics and data science! What started out as an effort to expand my scientific toolbox turned into a love affair with programming and predictive modeling that transformed my skill set and professional pursuits. I enjoy drawing insight from data and solving new challenges. 

When I have time outside of coding and family, I enjoy the ocean, beaches and trails around Santa Cruz.
