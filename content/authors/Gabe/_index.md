I have expertise as a biochemist but I am most passionate about bioinformatics and data science. What started out as an effort to expand my scientific toolbox turned into a love affair with programming and predictive modeling that has transformed my skill set and professional focus. I enjoy drawing insight from data and welcome new challenges. Please visit my [blog](https://www.gabemednick.com/) for more details.

In my free time, I enjoy the ocean, beaches and trails around Santa Cruz with my wife and fearless Chihuahua.
